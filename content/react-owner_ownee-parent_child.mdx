**Wait? Parent and owner? It's the same thing!**

Let us start by differentiating between them.

## Parent-Child Relationship.

The parent child relationship is formed by passing one component as a child to another component.

```JavaScript
function Parent({children})
{
    ...
}

function App()
{
    <Parent>
        <Child/>
    </Parent>
}
```

Here, we say that the <component>Parent</component> is the parent of <component>Child</component> component.

## Owner-Ownee Relationship

The owner-ownee relationship is formed by rendering the owned component inside the owner component.

```JavaScript
function Owner({children})
{
    <Ownee/>
}
```

Here, we say that the <component>Parent</component> is the parent of <component>Child</component> component.
